 ASSignment on Pseudo Colums
 
 
 1. select * from(
 select EMP.*,row_number() over() as row_num
 from EMP)
 
 as temp
 where row_num<=1;
 
 
 2. select* from
 (select EMP.*,row_number() over() as rownum 
 from EMP) as temp
 where rownum<=3;
 
 
 3. select* from
 (
 select EMP.*,row_number() over(order by empno desc) as rownum from EMP)
 as temp
 where rownum=1;
 
 4. last but one record mean
 
 
 5. select * from 
 ( select EMP.* ,row_number() over() as rownum from EMP)
 as temp
 where mod(rownum,2)=0;
 
 
 6. select * from 
 ( select EMP.* ,row_number() over() as rownum from EMP)
 as temp
 where mod(rownum,2)=1;
 
 7. select * from 
 ( select EMP.* ,row_number() over() as rownum 
 count(*) over() as totalrow
 
 from EMP)
 as temp
 where rownum<=totalrow/2;
 
 8. select* from
 ( select EMP.*, row_number() over(order by empno desc) as rownum,
 count(*) over() as totalrow
 from EMP)
 as temp
 where rownum<=totalrow/2;  //something is not write here
 
 9. select* from(
 select EMP.* ,row_number() over() as rownum
 from EMP) as temp
 where rownum=4;
 
 10.  select* from(
 select EMP.* ,row_number() over() as rownum
 from EMP) as temp
  
  where rownum in(1,3,5);
 
 
 11. select sal from
 ( select sal,row_number() over() as rownum
 from (select distinct sal from EMP
 order by sal desc) as temp2
 
 
 
 )as temp
 where rownum<=3;
 
 why not this
 select sal from EMP
 order by sal desc
 limit 3;
 
 
 12. select sal from
 (select sal,row_number() over() as rownum
 from ( select distinct sal from EMP order by sal)temp2
 
 
 ) as temp
 where rownum<=5;
 
 
 
 select distinct sal from EMP
 order by sal
 limit 5;
 
 
 13.  select sal from
 (select sal,row_number() over() as rownum
 from ( select distinct sal from EMP order by sal)temp2
 
 
 ) as temp
 where rownum in(1,3,5);
 
 
 14. select sal from
 (select sal,row_number() over(order by sal desc) as rownum,
 count(*) over() as totalrow
 from EMP) as temp
 where rownum in(1,totalrow);
 
 
 15. select sal from (
 select sal,row_number() over (order by sal) as rownum    //bootom 3 maximum salries
 from EMP) as temp
 where rownum<=3;
